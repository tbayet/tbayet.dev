My most recent, valuable and showable (work i did for my company stay private) demonstration is this **static** [**website**](https://github.com/tbayet/tbayet.dev) to introduce myself, made with **gatsby**/react/emotion, without any component library. I used **Netlify** for deployment via git, integrated a blog cms at /admin to feed the slider and the portfolio via markdown files, requesting via **graphql** in my components.
